# Hello GitHub 👋
This is my first Python project by Rikuto! It prints "Hello, GitHub!" to help me learn coding and Git. 🐈

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository: `git clone` [https://github.com/rikuto-mikado/hello-github.git]
2. Navigate to the folder: `cd hello-github`
3. Run the script: `python hello_github.py`

## What I Learned
- How to create a GitHub repository.
- How to add and commit a Python file.
- Basic steps of using Git.

## Future Ideas
- Try other programming languages like HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
